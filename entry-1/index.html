    First thing you should learn about Yakutia - or first thing you should look froward to if you're planning a trip there, - that I think will give you a comprehensive summary of what Sakha culture is is our most important celebration - <i>Yhyakh.</i>

   <p>
    <b>Yhyakh</b> - is the biggest and most important celebration of Sakha people. It's celebrated on the Summer Solstice, and people from all over Yakutia gather together to meet the summer, say our prayers, share songs, dances and participate in various national sports!
    <br>Traditionally, yhyakh was a gathering to both conduct a ritual to bless our lands for a prosperous summer in order to prepare for winter, and for families to meet each other, since Sakha people (before the Russian conquest) uised to live quite remote from each other. Young women would show their beauty and skills, while young men would compete to show off their physical prowess.
    <br>While it remains more or less the same today, I personally think the meaning of this celebration shifted to just celebrating our culture and became one of the means to preserve our traditions and customs. Sakha people use it as an opportunity to wear full traditional clothes and jewlery, share art from craft to throat singing, and to just have fun. Yhyakh still holds a very prominent significance to every Sakha person, regardless of age, and it's easily the most anticipated date in Yakutia!

    <h2>Few things you can experience at your trip</h2>
    <h3>Kumys drinking</h3>
    <p>
      Kumys is our national drink, and you may have heard of it if you know a little bit about Central Asia. Kumys is a fermented, carbonated drink out of horse milk. To drink it is one of our rituals, closely tied to our traditional believes. Kumys is considered a divine drink; it's believed that as our ancestor Elley Bootur held up a choroon (a traditional cup for kumys) to the sky, sterkh birds flew over Sakha Sire, symbolizing that the Ayii (our gods) blessed our lands.
      <br>And to drink kumys would symbolize a tight bond between a human and the world. Though I personally don't like kumys' taste it's important to realize its significance. Also! To give a choroon with kumys to someone else shows great respect and reverance.
    </p>
    <h3>Games of Tygyn</h3>
    <p>
      It may be the athletic highlight of the year in Yakutia. It's a multidiscipline sports competition. The most notable disciplines:
      <ul> 
        <li>hapsaghai - Sakha fighting style, focusing at the person's agility and speed,</li> 
        <li>maas-wrestling - its a sport where you need to drag a wooden stick to your side,</li>
        <li>and stone throwing competition - it's pretty straightforward. it's about throwing a big boulder as fas as you can.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Ohukhai</h3>
     <p>
      It's a Sakha traditional mass dance, when as many people as possible hold together arm in arm and go around in a circle, singing words of algys - a prayer for fortune and prosperity. Think of it as a flashmob, my friends and I loved to dance osuokhai at any given opportunity. It's not strictly ysyakh related, but no ysyakh goes without a massive osuokhai. It's a great opportunity to feel unity and to feel welcomed!
