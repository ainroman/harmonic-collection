        <i><h3>A Region of the Russian Federation</h3></i>
        <p>
          Yakutia is the biggest region of Russia, located in the Far East of Siberia. It's the north of Russia, and throughout my entire childhood I wondered why is Saint Petersburg called "The North Capital" of Russia if Yakutsk is right there?
          <br>I would love to write about our rich diamond and gold and whatever fossils you can name resources, but it seems like this theme is abundant as it is and frankly boring.
          <h4>
            So what is Yakutia then as a region? 
          </h4>
          <p>
            It's about hospitality, familial warmth and the kindest people. We love the rare sun, but we are also fond of the ever present snow. 
            <br>To truly visit Yakutia is to feel the region's diversity. We are a region with six nations native to these lands, and there are 120 nationalities living in Yakutia as of 2024.
